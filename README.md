Demos and Trials
================

This repo is a collection of half-baked ideas

It's a trial setup to see how github works to collect 
and formulate writings and ramblings on various topics.  
It is meant to easily view/add/search files of type 
rst/html/latex/python/css/javascript/c and perhaps others.

Read at your own risk! :)
